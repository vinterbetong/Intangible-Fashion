## Introduction
This is my React project for an E-commerce website showcasing the use of contexts and toastify for a functional cart system, with a sleek responsive design to be user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. A deployed live demo can be found [hosted on Netlify](https://polite-ganache-928772.netlify.app/).
